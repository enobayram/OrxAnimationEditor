OrxAnimationEditor
==================

The Orx Animation Editor has been created with a hope to satisfy the need for minimal animation editing without touching Orx config files. 
Skeletal animations are, as of now, out of the scope of this editor, 

The main features are:
* Create animations and frames
* Create animation sets (links, etc...)
* Edit various properties of frames graphically
* Edit (and visualize) offsets for each frame
* Visualize and organize animations and links inside an animation set
* View how a frame, animation or a sequence of them look
* Write all of these to a target config file.
* NOTE: It is not possible to parse an .ini file. But you can save the current editor data in a special format and load it later on. The saved editor state can be moved around in the filesystem together with the referenced files and it will keep functioning correctly.
* Help section
